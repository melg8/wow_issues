# Wow issues reported by me

## Wsg doesnt register flag carry
   - Original issue number: 1591
   - Opened: 00:28 18/07/2022

### Please, provide a clear description what the bug is: 
On my horde rogue character Melgo (not hardcore mode character, but with War Mode challenge enabled) - playing in bracket 40-49 on wsg - take alliance flag and take it to our base i can't place it and get +1 to our team. Our flag is on base and not captured by enemy team. If i drop my flag with right click on buf, and other horde player pick it up - he can score flag by simply entering ring around our flag. I myself cant score flag by entering red zone around our flag, by entering and going out from it, jumping, dropping and picking it up again. So i bassically can't score as flag capture.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:
- Go to wsg as Melgo in 40-49 bracket (maybe that behaviour same on other brackets)
- capture ally flag
- bring it to horde base
- Enter room with horde flag
- Enter circle around horde flag
- Nothing happens.

### Expected behavior. Describe how it should work: 
Should score as flag capture and get additional honor.

### Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:
Today were introduced fix for av backdoor jumping to make game fair. Main issue on topic was closed: #4082.
On horde side now backdoor jump is not accesible. But on alliance side there is still way to work around invisible wall that were introduced. Please fix it to make map more balanced.
Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible: Here is example of druid using backdoor jump on new version of map today.
After that he was trying to cap gy, so he didnt encounter any problems from last screen till gy. I observed druid

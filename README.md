## Wsg doesnt register flag carry
   - Original issue number: 1591
   - Opened: 00:28 18/07/2022

### Please, provide a clear description what the bug is: 
On my horde rogue character Melgo (not hardcore mode character, but with War Mode challenge enabled) - playing in bracket 40-49 on wsg - take alliance flag and take it to our base i can't place it and get +1 to our team. Our flag is on base and not captured by enemy team. If i drop my flag with right click on buf, and other horde player pick it up - he can score flag by simply entering ring around our flag. I myself cant score flag by entering red zone around our flag, by entering and going out from it, jumping, dropping and picking it up again. So i bassically can't score as flag capture.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:
- Go to wsg as Melgo in 40-49 bracket (maybe that behaviour same on other brackets)
- capture ally flag
- bring it to horde base
- Enter room with horde flag
- Enter circle around horde flag
- Nothing happens.

### Expected behavior. Describe how it should work: 
Should score as flag capture and get additional honor.

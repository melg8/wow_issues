# Wow issues reported by me

## Wsg doesnt register flag carry
   - Original issue number: 1591
   - Opened: 00:28 18/07/2022
   - Status: Closed

### Please, provide a clear description what the bug is: 
On my horde rogue character Melgo (not hardcore mode character, but with War Mode challenge enabled) - playing in bracket 40-49 on wsg - take alliance flag and take it to our base i can't place it and get +1 to our team. Our flag is on base and not captured by enemy team. If i drop my flag with right click on buf, and other horde player pick it up - he can score flag by simply entering ring around our flag. I myself cant score flag by entering red zone around our flag, by entering and going out from it, jumping, dropping and picking it up again. So i bassically can't score as flag capture.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:
- Go to wsg as Melgo in 40-49 bracket (maybe that behaviour same on other brackets)
- capture ally flag
- bring it to horde base
- Enter room with horde flag
- Enter circle around horde flag
- Nothing happens.

### Expected behavior. Describe how it should work: 
Should score as flag capture and get additional honor.

## Winterfall runners stack up in sneaky way as single mob
   - Original issue number: 4126

### Please, provide a clear description what the bug is:
Winterfall runners that roam across winterspring can stack up in the way, that player see them as single mob, while in reality there is three of them roaming in sync. This can be problematic for hardcore character, that will try to aggro single mob, and get 2 as gift.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior with as much detail as possible:
- Go to 63.4, 26.5 in winterspring
- Wait for roamers
- Observe something like this:

Their models and animations sync up, so only way to saw 3 of them is by using nameplates.
